# Advanced Effect Workshop

Welcome to the Advanced Effect Workshop! Weâ€™re extremely excited to have you all here!

The goal of this workshop is to explore advanced patterns and strategies that we have observed are frequently utilized when building non-trivial Effect programs and applications. We will focus on learning common design patterns that will build in complexity throughout the workshop and will provide you with advanced building blocks to power your Effect applications.
